HOW TO COMPILE:

1. Unzip the file (this file will assume the directory created by unzipping is 'fugateka_program1')

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory 'fugateka_program1'.

3. Once in this terminal, you can either run the command 'make', 'make all', or 'make movies'. 
   This will create the 'movies' executable.

4. Once this exectuable is created, run the command './movies CSV_NAME.csv' to run the executable.
   (NOTE: replace 'CSV_NAME.csv' with your desired csv file to read from. i.e. in my case, i use 
   'movies_sample_1.csv' for testing)
